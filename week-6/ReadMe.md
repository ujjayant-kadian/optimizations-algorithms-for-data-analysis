## üìå Overview  
This repository contains the report and accompanying Jupyter notebook for the **Week 6 Assignment** of *Optimisation for Machine Learning (CS7DS2)*. The assignment explores various gradient descent optimization techniques, analyzing their effectiveness in minimizing a given loss function.  

The key topics covered in the notebook include:  
- Implementation of **Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**  
- Investigating the effect of **batch size** and **step-size strategies**  
- Comparing **advanced optimization methods**, including:  
  - **Polyak Step Size**  
  - **RMSProp (Adaptive Learning Rate)**  
  - **Heavy Ball (Momentum-based Update)**  
  - **Adam (Adaptive + Momentum-based Optimization)**
